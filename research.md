## Paraphrase generation & recognition

### Phrase alignment
Phrase alignment aims to extract phrasal paraphrases with syntactic structures through the development of phrase alignment methods between sentential paraphrase pair. It also targets on development of applications that benefit from the alignment technology. Paraphrases are a valuable resource for various tasks, such as a conversation system, question answering, and data augmentation for NLP. Little attention has been paid to the syntactic structures in paraphrases, especially phrasal paraphrases. Lack of structural information disturbs the generalization of paraphrasal knowledge and hinders applications of paraphrases. This project stands for the challenge in phrase alignment.

#### Datasets
We have created datasets for phrase alignment that (1) provide ground-truth tree structures (HPSG) and (2) provide ground-truth phrase alignments. 

* SPADE, an evaluation dataset with 201 paraphrasal sentence pairs: [LDC2018T09](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2018T09).
* ESPADA, a training (most likely for fine-tuning pre-trained masked language models) dataset with 1,916 paraphrasal sentence pairs: [LDC2021T10](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2021T10).
