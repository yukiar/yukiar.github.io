Yuki Arase is an associate professor at the graduate school of information science and technology, Osaka University, Japan. She was previously an associate researcher at the natural language computing group of Microsoft Research Asia. My primary research interest is in paraphrasing, conversation systems, and educational applications for language learners. She earned her Ph. D. of Information Science at Osaka University in 2010 for research on presenting a large amount of information on small screens.

Apart from research, I enjoy yoga practice, always traveling with a yoga mat in my luggage trolley.

#### Paraphrase generation & recognition
Paraphrasing takes various forms of monolingual text transformations, such as text simplification, rewriting, and style transfer. 
We work on both recognition and generation. The core technologies are intelligent phrase alignment and controllable paraphrase generation.

#### Representation learning
Vector representation of words, phrases, and sentences are the very basis for NLP research. We study
1. sophisticated representations for word meaning in context and multilingual sentences,
2. efficient pre-trained models for words and phrases, and
3. representations for few-shot learning.

#### NLP for language education & learning
As a central application of our research outcomes, we develop technologies for language learning and education supports. 
Our technology covers from fine-grained lexical-level transformations to coarse-grained text-level processing.
