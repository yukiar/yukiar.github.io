I am a professor at the School of Computing, Institute of Science Tokyo (aka Tokyo Institute of Technology), Japan. After obtaining my PhD in Information Science from Osaka University (2010), I worked for Microsoft Research Asia, where I started NLP research that continues to captivate me to this day. My research interests focus on paraphrasing and NLP technology for language education and healthcare.

I'm recruiting PhD students and postdocs. Please send me your CV with a publication list if you are interested. 
Note that we do not have "research student" positions.

## Research
For more details, please see [Research](./research.md) page.

#### Paraphrase generation & recognition
Paraphrasing takes various forms of monolingual text transformations, such as text simplification, rewriting, and style transfer. 
We work on both recognition and generation. The core technologies are intelligent phrase alignment and controllable paraphrase generation.

#### Representation learning
Vector representation of words, phrases, and sentences are the very basis for NLP research. We study
1. sophisticated representations for word meaning in context and multilingual sentences,
2. efficient pre-trained models for words and phrases, and
3. representations for few-shot learning.

#### NLP for language education & learning
As a central application of our research outcomes, we develop technologies for language learning and education supports. 
Our technology covers from fine-grained lexical-level transformations to coarse-grained text-level processing.
